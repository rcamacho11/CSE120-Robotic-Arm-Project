# CSE120-Robotic-Arm-Project
This project programs a UR10 robotic arm for automated welding using a Jetson Orion, MOVEit, and ROS. A stereo camera enables precise perception for accurate weld path planning and execution. The goal is to enhance welding precision and efficiency through advanced robotic control and computer vision.
